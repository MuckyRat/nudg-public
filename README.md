* **Active Insulin (IOB)**: Shows both rapid and long-acting insulin on board, with the ability to view expiry times.
* **Pending Dose Confirmation**: An optional safety feature that requires users to manually confirm an insulin injection before it's logged to Nightscout, preventing accidental logging.

### Data Logging
* **Comprehensive Entry Types**: Log bolus/basal insulin, carbohydrates, ketones, fluid intake, and weight.

* **Health Records**: Keep track of important health events like eye screenings, blood tests, HbA1c results, and hospital appointments.
* **Tagging System**: Create and assign custom tags to meals to categorize them and enable advanced meal pattern analysis.

### Calculators & Tools

* **Quick Bolus Calculator**: A streamlined tool for calculating a meal bolus based on carbohydrate intake and current glucose levels.
* **Nutrition Calculator**: Estimates carbohydrate counts for meals by querying the Nutritionix database.

### Analysis & Reporting
* **Advanced Analytics**: A dedicated view to analyze glucose data over various time ranges (1, 7, 14, 30 days), showing metrics like Estimated HbA1c, Time in Range, Standard Deviation, and Coefficient of Variation.
* **Post-Meal Analysis**: Tapping on a meal entry provides a detailed view of the post-prandial glucose response, including peak glucose, time to peak, and AI-generated insights.
* **PDF Report Generation**: Create professional, shareable PDF reports summarizing glucose data, treatments, and key statistics for a selected date range.

### Integrations
